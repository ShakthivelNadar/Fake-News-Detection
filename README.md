# Fake-News-Detection
Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to accurately classify news articles as either 'Real' or 'Fake'. In an era of rampant misinformation, such a tool can be crucial for verifying the authenticity of information.

The solution leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF for text vectorization, combined with a Logistic Regression classifier, to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate and fabricated news.

Features
Data Loading & Preprocessing: Handles CSV datasets, concatenates fake and real news, assigns labels, and shuffles data.
Text Cleaning: Includes functions for lowercasing, removing punctuation, and eliminating stopwords from news text.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.
Model Training: Employs a Logistic Regression model for classification.
Model Evaluation: Provides accuracy score, classification report (precision, recall, f1-score), and a confusion matrix visualization.
Prediction Function: A utility to predict whether a given news text is 'Fake News' or 'Real News'.
Dataset
The project uses two CSV files:

Fake.csv: Contains news articles labeled as fake.
True.csv: Contains news articles labeled as true.
Each dataset typically includes columns like title, text, subject, and date.

Methodology
Data Loading: Load Fake.csv and True.csv into pandas DataFrames.
Labeling: Assign a label column to each dataset (1 for fake news, 0 for real news).
Concatenation & Shuffling: Combine both datasets and randomly shuffle the combined data.
Text Preprocessing:
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove punctuation.
Remove English stopwords using NLTK.
Feature Engineering: Apply TF-IDF Vectorization to the cleaned text data to transform it into numerical features suitable for machine learning models. A max_features of 5000 was used to limit the vocabulary size.
Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test). A Logistic Regression model is then trained on the TF-IDF vectorized training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using accuracy, classification report, and a confusion matrix.
Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries. You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
Don't forget to download NLTK stopwords:

import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
Usage
Clone the repository (if applicable):

git clone cd fake-news-detection ``` 2. **Place Data**: Ensure your Fake.csv and True.csv files are in the expected directory (or update the paths in the code). 3. **Run the Notebook/Script**: Execute the Python notebook (.ipynb) or script (.py) step-by-step.

Here's a snippet demonstrating the prediction function:

def predict_news(news_text):
    cleaned_text = clean_text(news_text)
    vector = tfidf.transform([cleaned_text])
    prediction = model.predict(vector)
    return "Fake News" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Real News"

# Example Usage:
print(predict_news("Government announces new education reforms"))
print(predict_news("Breaking: Aliens land on Earth, demand world peace"))
Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved a high accuracy:

Accuracy: 98.9%
Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.99      0.99      0.99      4312

weighted avg       0.99      0.99      0.99      8980
Confusion Matrix:
(A visualization of the confusion matrix would typically be generated by the seaborn and matplotlib code in the notebook, showing high true positives and true negatives, with very few false positives/negatives.)

Example Prediction
After training the model, you can use the predict_news function to classify new text:

news_article_1 = "New study reveals chocolate is good for your health."
print(f"'{news_article_1}' is predicted as: {predict_news(news_article_1)}")

news_article_2 = "Exclusive: Bigfoot spotted buying groceries at local supermarket."
print(f"'{news_article_2}' is predicted as: {predict_news(news_article_2)}")
